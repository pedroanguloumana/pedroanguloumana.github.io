My research focuses on the multiscale dynamics of tropical convection and its interaction
with large-scale circulation.

## Convective organization

Describe what you study, why it matters, how you approach it.

## Tropical waves and large-scale modes

Another subtopic.

## Methods

Talk about modelling, observations, reanalyses, ML, etc.
