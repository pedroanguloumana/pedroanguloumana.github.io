Welcome to my homepage!

I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Convective Systems/Tropical Dynamics Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/snu.ac.kr/tropicalconvectionandwaves) at the [School of Earth and Environmental Sciences](https://sees.snu.ac.kr/en) of [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) in Seoul, South Korea. I am broadly interested in tropical meteorology, with particular interest in how tropical circulations couple to deep convection. 

I recieved my PhD in Atmospheric and Climate Science from the [University of Washington](https://atmos.uw.edu/) under the supervision of Professors [Peter Blossey](https://www.atmos.washington.edu/~bloss/)and [Daehyun Kim](https://sees.snu.ac.kr/en/research-faculty/faculty/fulltime?mode=view&profidx=86) (now at SNU). My dissertation investigated the dynamics of tropical convection precipitation at a range of scales, from individual convective systems to large-scale circulations.
